# @pindakaasman/architecture-plugin

## 0.7.2

### Patch Changes

- 13a1167: `design-system` skill: document the `ssrBreakpoint` option for choosing which breakpoint tokens resolve to during SSR.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- d8af0cf: Wire this repo's own `configs/*` into its own root (`eslint.config.mjs`,
  `prettier.config.js`, a `pnpm lint`/`format`/`test`/`build` CI job) and fix
  what that turned up:
  
  - `design-system` - `get()` no longer returns `any` (now `unknown`, matching
    its own README); `System`'s `[prop: string]: any` catch-all is removed
    (`get()` still works - `ramda`'s `path()` doesn't need it); the unused,
    never-referenced `SystemOptions`/`SystemOptionalKey` exports are dropped.
  - `eslint-config` - the base export now includes Node globals, derived from
    linting this repo's own tooling scripts (the first real non-Next consumer
    of the base config).
  - `mise-place` - `string[]`/`unknown[]` switched to `Array<T>`, per the
    typescript plugin's own stated convention.
  - `architecture` plugin - fixed a missing `=>` in the `data-flow` skill's
    "good" example (was showing invalid syntax for the exact arrow-function
    convention it was demonstrating).

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 8f460e4: Add each concern plugin's own `setup` skill, so `/init:setup` (and
  `npx @pindakaasman/mise-place`) can plan and apply real changes instead of
  reporting "no setup skill yet" for every plugin:
  
  - `typescript:setup` - installs and wires up `@pindakaasman/tsconfig`,
    `@pindakaasman/eslint-config`, and `@pindakaasman/prettier-config`.
  - `architecture:setup` - scaffolds/migrates the atomic folder structure and
    the design-system theme, and audits state-management/module-boundaries/
    data-flow conventions.
  - `react:setup` - audits and migrates existing components against
    `component-patterns`.
  - `testing:setup` - installs Vitest always, Storybook/Playwright when the
    project's environment warrants them, and migrates misplaced tests.
